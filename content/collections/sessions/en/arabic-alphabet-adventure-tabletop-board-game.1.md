<p>Main Objective</p><p>To strengthen Arabic language skills and foster interactive bonding between the child and parent through fun, collaborative play</p><p>Concept</p><p>Players move across a board with 28 spaces, each representing a letter of the Arabic alphabet. The child rolls the dice and moves forward accordingly. On the square they land on, the child says a word starting with that letter (e.g., a fruit, color, or animal), and the parent says something from Emirati culture (e.g., food, tradition, or value) that starts with the same letter.</p>
