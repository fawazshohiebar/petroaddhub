<p>A quiet revolution is reshaping how we make food, driven by science, ethics, and necessity. Precision fermentation, cellular agriculture, and hybrid proteins are no longer theoretical; they are entering markets as costs fall, and approvals accelerate. Recent breakthroughs in serum-free growth media, scaffold technologies, and microbial engineering are driving down production costs and redefining how we create protein, while reducing emissions and land use. This keynote explores the forces that will define the next five years - science, investment, regulation, and shifting consumer demand.</p>
