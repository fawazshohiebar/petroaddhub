<p>Food is more than nourishment — it is a cornerstone of national resilience. As nations seek to balance economic growth with security and sustainability, the food sector emerges as a strategic driver of both prosperity and protection. This session explores how strengthening local food production, investing in agri-tech, and developing resilient supply chains not only boost the national economy but also reinforce food security and self-sufficiency.</p>
