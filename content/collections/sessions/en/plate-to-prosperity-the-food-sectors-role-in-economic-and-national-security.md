<p>Food is more than nourishment — it is a cornerstone of national resilience.

This session explores how strengthening local food production, investing in agri-tech, and developing resilient supply chains not only boost the national economy but also reinforce food security and self-sufficiency.</p><p>Senior Representative, DED</p><p>Senior Representative, AD Food Hub (UAE)</p><p>Senior Representative, ADIO (UAE)</p><p>Nadine Gbossa, Director of Food Systems Coordination, IFAD (Italy)</p><p>Malachy Mitchell, Co-founder and Managing Director, Farrelly Mitchell (Ireland)</p>
