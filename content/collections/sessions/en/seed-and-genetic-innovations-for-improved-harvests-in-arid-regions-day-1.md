As climate change accelerates and water scarcity intensifies, arid and semi-arid regions are facing mounting pressure to produce more food with fewer resources. In this critical landscape, seed and genetic innovations are emerging as game-changing tools to boost crop productivity, enhance resilience, and secure livelihoods. Explore how advances in plant genetics, drought-resistant seed varieties, and biotechnology are helping farmers overcome the harsh realities of extreme heat, poor soils, and limited rainfall.
