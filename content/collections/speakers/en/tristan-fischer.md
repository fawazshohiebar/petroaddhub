Tristan Fischer is the founder and Group CEO of Fischer Farms, an Agri-Tech company revolutionizing the future of sustainable food production through controlled environment agriculture. A green energy expert and sustainability pioneer, Tristan brings over 20 years of experience in clean energy infrastructure and sustainable innovation.

Tristan began his journey into vertical farming in 2017, growing short leafy greens in a shipping container beneath his wife's vanity table. Recognizing the potential for a scalable and sustainable solution to global food security challenges, he launched Fischer Farms. Since then, the business has expanded rapidly, from its first facility in Burton-on-Trent, which opened in 2019 with 3,200 m² of growing space, to one of the world’s largest vertical farms in Norwich, which opened in 2023 and spans 25,000 m² of vertically stacked growing space across 4 acres.

Today, Fischer Farms, backed by Gresham House plc, remains at the forefront of combining Agri-Tech with renewable energy to produce ethical, high-quality crops using cutting-edge technology. As the firm continues to scale, Fischer Farms will soon launch its autonomous, modular smart growing systems, building on decades of vertical farming expertise. These next-generation solutions enable precision growers to scale reliably and profitably, while driving greater efficiency, resilience, and sustainability in food production. By combining engineering excellence with proven experience, Tristan is shaping a more secure and scalable future for agriculture.

In addition to Fischer Farms, Tristan’s Agri-Tech interests include FishFrom Ltd, a land-based salmon farming company, and Great British Prawns Ltd, a land-based shrimp venture—both utilizing Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) technology. He also served as Chairman of C-Capture, a carbon capture technology company, and as a board director of Dukosi Ltd, a smart battery innovator.

Previously, Tristan was Chairman and CEO of Lumicity, which developed over £145 millions of UK agricultural infrastructure assets, including large-scale solar projects and biomass energy systems for the poultry sector. His career spans major organizations such as Citigroup and Shell, as well as SMEs like Camco, which he successfully listed on AIM—delivering a sixfold increase in shareholder value.
